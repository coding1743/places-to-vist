        <h5 class="card-title">Jatayu statue</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Jatayu was a demi-god in Ramayana (a Hindu epic) who had the form of a vulture. According to the epic, Ravana was attempting to abduct Sita to Lanka when Jatayu tried to rescue her.Although Jatayu is eventually defeated and killed by Ravana, the sympathies of the painter are clearly with the courageous bird, which is portrayed as an enormous figure dominating the picture frame. The bird's profile is majestically rendered with his sharp beak, deadly talons and a steady gaze focussed on his enemy.According to the legends, it is believed that Jatayu fell on the rocks in Chadayamangalam in Kerala after his wings were cut off by Ravana while abducting Sita. After narrating the incident of Sita's abduction to Sri Rama and Lakshmana, the wounded Jatayu died. Sri Rama then performed the final funeral rites of Jatayu.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Kashmir</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Kashmir is the northernmost geographical region of the Indian subcontinent. Until the mid-19th century, the term "Kashmir" denoted only the Kashmir Valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal Range.In 1820, the Sikh Empire, under Ranjit Singh, annexed Kashmir. In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Kashmir. The rule of his descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage) of the British Crown, lasted until the Partition of India in 1947, when the former princely state of the British Indian Empire became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: China, India, and Pakistan.
          Etymology
          The word Kashmir is thought to have been derived from Sanskrit and was referred to as káśmīra. A popular local etymology of Kashmira is that it is land desiccated from water.</p>
